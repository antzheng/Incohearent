## About

An adaptation of the popular [card game](https://www.amazon.com/Incohearent-Adult-Party-Game-What/dp/B07QSCQMXV) as an Alexa Skill!

* **GET TALKING:** This is the party game for adults that will keep you guessing! Let the laughs begin as you compete with friends to see who can make the most sense out of the nonsense.

* **HOW TO PLAY:** To start the game, just tell Alexa to "start Incohearent Game." Alexa will spout out some gibberish that will represent a phrase for you to guess. You can guess as many times as you want, and you'll be rewarded with a new phrase each time you guess correctly. To stop the game at any time, just tell Alexa "stop" or "cancel." Compete with your friends for some laughs and good times. Enjoy!

* **ADULTS ONLY:** This game contains mature language. Audience discretion is advised.
